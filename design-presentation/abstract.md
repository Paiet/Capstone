# Abstract

ICS is used worldwide to control and monitor processes within industrial factories, agriculture, water treatment, and nuclear power. An issue is that no neutral third party has yet to test most systems. Testing malware against ICS may provide a comprehensive look at their defensive capabilities. This capstone will investigate ICS used in manufacturing settings to provide meaningful data to manufacturers on how to best secure their infrastructure against cyber threats.
